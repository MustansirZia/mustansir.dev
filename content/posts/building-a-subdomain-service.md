> *This article is a follow up to a live stream that I recorded on Twitch. In this live stream we did the following:*

• We built a subdomain service (We called it the Pokemon Service!) that can serve different web pages based on the subdomain from which it was accessed from. 

• For example, **pikachu.domain.com** would serve a page related to Pikachu, similarly **charmander.domain.com**, etc. The app served requests coming in to ***.domain.com** dynamically based on the slug before the domain.com.

• Along the way, we also talked about clean code and what abstractions or patterns make sense here.

• For this tutorial, we used [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

• It was a Node.js application and we deployed it to the cloud using [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com).

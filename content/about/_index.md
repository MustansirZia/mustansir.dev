## ”Premature optimization is the root of all evil, 97% of the time; Yet we should not pass opportunities in that critical 3%.” - David Knut

## What I am and generally do:

I’m a polyglot programmer who solves problems through code. I can think
logically in a variety of different languages and believe a good developer
should never be restricted by platform or language. I hate stereotyping and
respect other people’s opinion in a workspace. I like to write poetry and not prose. I'm always on a lookout for tools that improve my code and my workflow.

While I'm not doing all that I think about traveling the world and riding a bike with my wife.

<br />

## What kind of work I like:
I'm thrilled by bleeding edge. I get bored of using a decade old technology to solve a problem that has been solved decades ago. 
I'm also looking for people who understand the value of time and respect flexibility among their colleagues. Remote work is one such example.

<br />

## What is my present job title:
Full Stack Developer (who also does occasional DevOps).

<br />

## What this site is about:
Well, this site is basically my blog about all things I like to work on or think about on a daily basis. And at the time of this writing, it is software development and computers. 
<br />
(I also plan to write posts about stuff that's not related to development but that's another story altogether)

Cheers!

## ‚ÄùPremature optimization is the root of all evil, 97% of the time; Yet we should not pass opportunities in that critical 3%.‚Äù - David Knut

<br />

## Here's my introduction::
I‚Äôm (almost) a polyglot programmer who solves problems through code. I hate stereotyping and respect other people‚Äôs opinion in a workspace. <br />
Even though I know it's not possible or feasible sometimes, but I'd still prefer writing <b>clean</b> code any day. And <b>smart</b> code isn't always clean üí°. I‚Äôm also always on a lookout for tools that improve my code and my workflow.

I really admire people who understand the value of time and respect flexibility among their colleagues. Remote work is one such example.

When I‚Äôm not pushing commits, I think about traveling the world and riding a bike with my wife.

## Here's what I like to work with:
I'm thrilled by bleeding edge. I get bored of using a decade old technology to solve a problem that has been solved decades ago. 

<br />

## Here's what I do professionally:
I'm part of geographically distributed team called [Hubilo](https://hubilo.com). We help bring people together in virtual events and try to recreate experiences that are akin to physical meetups.

I spend most of my time authoring and maintaining Hubilo's distributed backend.

<br />

## Here's my present job title:
Software Development Engineer II (who loves to work all through the stack).

<br />

## Here's what this site is about:
Well, this site is basically my blog about all things I like to work on or think about on a daily basis. And at the time of this writing, it is software development and computers. 
<br />
(I also plan to write posts about stuff that's not related to development but that's another story altogether)

Cheers!
